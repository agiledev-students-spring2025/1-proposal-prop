### Project title

AI-Driven Data Organizing and Analysis 

### What and why?

The project will aim to be able to organize data feed into it and organize it first if asked by the user. Then after that, the user could ask to interpret the data with what the user got out of the data. This will be leveraged by accessing current LLMs. The AI will finally generate a report on the given task.

### For whom?

The software will be for people who have data on hand and need it to be interperted or organized. 


### How?

Assume a very basic scinaro where we have the data of many single households across the country. This will attempt to organize it and give a detailed response to the results such as average income across the country, or the average in a selected area and perhaps compare to past data we already have and draw some sort of conclusiion or insight for the user. 

### Scope
The project should be managable with around 4-6 people since it does not require creating a LLM but rather just accessing the LLM and using it a specific way.
